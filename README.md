# Phoenix Chat Manager
Chat Popout with custom server integration

by _kritanta, for Minecraft/Forge 1.8.9

### For devs/admins wanting to add new channels, it only takes a single line of code. I've explained how to do it here:

https://github.com/PhoenixModTeam/chat/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/dev/phoenix/chat/server/Hypixel.kt#L27

### For devs wanting to change/edit/work on this project, I've documented the project layout, and every single class in this project here:

https://github.com/PhoenixModTeam/chat/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/dev/phoenix/chat

Each class also includes plenty of comments and docstrings.
